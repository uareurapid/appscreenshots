   - Sign in with your Anthropic account

4. **Open in Claude Desktop**
   - Open Claude Desktop app
   - Click the "Code" tab at the top
   - Click "Open Folder" and select the cloned repository folder

5. **Start the app**
   - Simply type: **"start the app"**
   - Claude will automatically start the server and tell you which URL to open in your browser
   - Claude monitors the server and reports any issues

6. **Make changes**
   - Ask Claude to modify features, fix bugs, or add functionality
   - Claude will show you the proposed commit message before committing
   - All changes are automatically saved to Git

No command line, no technical setup - just chat with Claude!

#### Option 2: Run Locally (Command Line)

Since this app uses IndexedDB for persistence, you need to serve it through a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python
cd appscreen
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

#### Option 3: VS Code Live Server

If you have the "Live Server" extension installed in VS Code, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

#### Option 4: Docker

Run the pre-built Docker image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Using Docker directly
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/yuzu-hub/appscreen:latest

# Using Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

#### Building locally

If you want to build the image yourself:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d
```

## Usage

1. **Upload Screenshots**: Drag and drop your app screenshots or click to browse
2. **Choose Output Size**: Select the target device size from the sidebar
3. **Customize Background**: Choose gradient, solid color, or image background
